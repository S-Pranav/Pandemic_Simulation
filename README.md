# Pandemic Simulation
Looking at how different parameters affect the spread of a pandemic

The first activity to do is to create a baseline model which does the simulation as necessary with many of the required parameters.
This model is then verified by changing the parameters and comparing the effects that they have to what is actually expected theoretically.

Eg : increasing the probability of catching the disease if you stray close to an infected person should increase the rate of transimission, so should
increasing the radisu of infectivity. These are used as a sanity check of the model.

The second part is to add different conditions to the model that simulate the real life actions that we take to reduce the spread. This includes a mechanism
for quarantine, contact tracing and closing of communal areas
